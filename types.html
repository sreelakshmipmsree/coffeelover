                <h3>Black Coffee</h3>
                No frills here: Black coffee is made from plain ground coffee beans
                that are brewed hot. It's served without added sugar, milk, or flavorings.

                <h3>Decaf</h3>
                Coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, but roasters can use several
                different processes to remove almost all of it. Decaf coffee is brewed with
                these decaffeinated beans.

            <p>
                <h3>Espresso</h3>
                Most people know that a shot of espresso is stronger than the same amount of coffee,
                but what's the difference, exactly? There isn't anything inherently different about
                the beans themselves, but when beans are used to make espresso they're more finely
                ground, and they're brewed with a higher grounds-to-water ratio than what's used for
                coffee.

            <p>
                <h3>Latte</h3>
                This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer
                of foam, but coffee shops have come up with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment
                with flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy version by using oat milk.
                Skilled baristas often swirl the foam into latte art!

            <p>
                <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
                This espresso-based drink is similar to a latte, but the frothy top layer is thicker.
                The standard ratio is equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. It's often served
                in a 6-ounce cup (smaller than a latte cup) and can be topped with a sprinkling of cinnamon.
            </p>

                    <h3>Americano</h3>
                    Order this drink and you'll get a shot of espresso diluted with hot water.
                </p>

            <div>

                <p>
                    <h3>Irish Coffee</h3>
                    This boozy drink is a combination of black coffee, whiskey, and sugar, topped with a dollop
                    of whipped cream. Ree's mom used to make Irish coffee all the time, and now Ree does, too.
